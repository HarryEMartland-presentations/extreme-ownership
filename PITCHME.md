## What is Ownership?

Note:

Something which belongs to you
So something you care about
Something you look after
You can do whatever you like with it

Leasing a car vs owning a car - The company will pay for services

## Ownership for Software

Note:
Responsibility for bugs
Fixing things
Looking after legacy applications
Stopping problems from happening again

---

## Extreme Ownership

Note:
Taking ownership of things you don't directly own
Stop saying "that's not my problem", "they should sort it out"
If you want something doing then get it done
Take ownership of other peoples actions

---

## Extreme Ownership for Software

Note: 

Your team is given a legacy application to look after, Don't just blame things on it being legacy.
Try to make it better, fix the bugs, work with the users.

You are investigating a bug but find the root cause to be in another teams domain. 
Rather than chucking the bug over the fence work with the other team to fix it together.

## When should you take Extreme Ownership

## Examples

Note:

People are misusing an application, after telling them better ways of doing things they still don't change.
Change the application in ways to encourage better behaviour. 

Jocko Willink (Marine). A operation went wrong due to a number of different peoples mistakes.
During the de brief he as commanding officer took responsibility for it.
